# WindSite

WindSite is an application identifies ideal locations for future wind farm development. Building on work done by NREL, this application narrows the search for wind farm sites by leveraging multiple data sources and machine learning.

## Instructions

You can access the app at http://datadoctor.site: .

The app balances 3 weighted factor in order to recommend sites
- Transmission line proximity
- Road proximity
- Estimated price per acre (ppa)

The user can adjust the relative importance of these factors by adjusting the three weight sliders: a larger weight means that the app will place a higher priority on that factor.
